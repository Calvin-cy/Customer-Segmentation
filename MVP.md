## MVP
The goal of this project is to classify the VIP class, create a cohort analysis to evaluate the retention rate, and do a basket analysis to get related items for cross-selling

I will use three metrics to identify the VIP, and the three metrics are recency, frequency, and monetary.

The minimum viable product is to at least identify the VIP class of the customers so the retail company can keep the VIP class as their loyal customer by giving out discounts to them.
